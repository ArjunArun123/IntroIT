Smart Parking barrier system:
A local university wants to implement a smart parking barrier system at its main gate, designed to automatically open for registered staff and students, count the number of cars in the parking lot, display the number
of available spots, and trigger an error when someone tries to enter when the parking is full. The objective is to simulate and implement the logic using the Integrated Problem-Solving Process.

Problem Statement:

Implement a smart parking barrier system at a university gate
System must authenticate registered users (staff/students)
Track vehicle count in the lot
Display available parking spots
Prevent entry when parking is full with an alert

Key Requirements:

User authentication/registration system
Vehicle counting mechanism
Available spots calculation
Full parking alert system
Barrier control logic
