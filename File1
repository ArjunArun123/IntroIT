Smart Parking barrier system:
A local university wants to implement a smart parking barrier system at its main gate, designed to automatically open for registered staff and students, count the number of cars in the parking lot, display the number
of available spots, and trigger an error when someone tries to enter when the parking is full. The objective is to simulate and implement the logic using the Integrated Problem-Solving Process.
